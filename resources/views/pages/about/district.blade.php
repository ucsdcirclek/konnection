            The first Circle K club was founded in 1947, and the California-Nevada-Hawaii District was one of the two founding Districts of Circle K International, along with the Michigan District. California-Nevada-Hawaii was instrumental in the internationalization of the organization. Chartered on December 12, 1957, the district was founded with thirty-one clubs and has grown to over forty clubs at the present.
