            UCSD Circle K is a part of <strong>Cal-Nev-Ha</strong> district, which comprises California, Nevada, and Hawaii. CNH is the largest district in CKI. From the black sand beaches of Hawaii, the glamour of Hollywood, to the world's playground of Las Vegas, the California-Nevada-Hawaii District spans over 2700 miles to include some of the most dynamic and diverse parts of the world. With 40 clubs and over 1,000 members spanning these three states, Cal-Nev-Ha serves as a shining beacon to its fellow districts.

            The first Circle K club was founded in 1947, and the California-Nevada-Hawaii District was one of the two founding Districts of Circle K International, along with the Michigan District. California-Nevada-Hawaii was instrumental in the internationalization of the organization. Chartered on December 12, 1957, the district was founded with thirty-one clubs and has grown to over forty clubs at the present.
