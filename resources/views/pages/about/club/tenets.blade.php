    <p>Circle K International follows three core tenets:</p>

    <p><b>Service</b> is the heart of CKI that sets it apart from other campus activities. Each year over 1 million
        hours of community service are done by CKI members worldwide.</p>

    <p><b>Leadership</b> opportunities allow members to step up to gain experience working in the real world through
        service, or through club leadership. They also provide valuable tools and influences towards becoming an active
        citizen.
    </p>

    <p><b>Fellowship</b> is a part of every aspect of CKI. Members develop lifelong friendships that strengthen daily
        through service and interaction and can gain strong relationships with Kiwanians, advisors, as well as with
        peers.</p>
