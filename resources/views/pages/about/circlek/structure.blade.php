    <p>CKI operates on an international, sub-regional, district, divisional, and club level. More than 13,000 members
        make up about 500 clubs in 30 districts and 17 nations, including Antigua, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Canada,
        Cayman Islands, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Malaysia, México, Nigeria, Panama, Philippines,
        St. Lucia, Suriname, Taiwan and the United States.</p>
    <h4>Club</h4>

    <p>This level is comprised of members within a particular school or university. Here, a board of officers runs the
        operations of the club. A President, Administrative Vice President, Service Vice President, Treasurer, and
        Secretary make up the Executive Board. </p>
    <h4>Division</h4>

    <p>Each club is part of a division, which is comprised of other clubs within a close demographic area. </p>
    <h4>District</h4>

    <p>Each club in a division then falls under a district which is usually bounded by state lines. During the annual
        district convention, delegates from all clubs in the district elect a Governor, Secretary, and Treasurer to service on the District Executive Board. A board of district chairs is then appointed in
        order to carry out specific district focuses and events throughout the year in which clubs from all over the
        district can participate and attend. </p>
    <h4>Sub-region</h4>

    <p>Every sub-region is a collective of several bordering districts based on size, demographic, and cultures. Every
        year at International Convention the sub-region elects a Trustee to be the voice and bridge to
        international.</p>
    <h4>International</h4>

    <p>Of all 30 districts in the organization, they together comprise Circle K International. At this level, there is
        an International President and Vice President as well as 7 elected Sub-regional Trustees and a Trustee-at-Large.
        These Trustees carry out the interests of Circle K international as a whole, as well as for each
        individual sub-region.</p>
