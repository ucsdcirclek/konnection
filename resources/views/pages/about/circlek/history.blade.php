@section('about-content')
    <p>CKI began in 1936 as a Kiwanis club service project to provide an opportunity for capable, ambitious, and
        worthy young men to acquire a college education by assisting them, where necessary, with their financial
        problems, by means of a scholarship fund, if available, or securing part-time employment. Soon after the concept
        of CKI was recognized and accepted, the element of community service was introduced, thus creating an appealing
        outlet for collegians around the globe. </p>

    <p>Today, as the largest collegiate service organization, CKI boasts a membership of more than 13,000 collegians
        on more than 500 campuses worldwide. CKI is a student-led organization with an International Board of
        Representatives elected by its membership each year. Embodied by its tenets of leadership, fellowship, and
        service at the club, district and International levels, CKI continues to grow through service to the world's
        campuses and communities.
