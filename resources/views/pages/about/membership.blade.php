        <h2>Step 2: Submit your Dues!</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Step 3: Submit the Above!</h2>
        <p>That's it! You just need to submit the membership form along with your dues and you are an official,
            dues paid member of UCSD Circle K! Your membership form and dues are due at the Week 3 GBM if you'd like to be
